TinyURL is a URL shortening service developed using Node.js with Express.js framework, MongoDB for data storage, Redis for caching, and Passport.js for authentication.
## Components Used:

<b>Express.js</b>: Express is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It handles routing, middleware, and HTTP request/response handling.

<b>MongoDB:</b> MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. In this case, it's used to store mappings between the original long URLs and their corresponding short URLs generated by the service.

<b>Redis:</b> Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a cache and message broker. In the context of a URL shortener like TinyURL, Redis can be used to cache frequently accessed short URLs, reducing the need to query MongoDB for every redirection request.

<b>Passport.js:</b> Passport.js is an authentication middleware for Node.js. It supports various authentication mechanisms known as strategies (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT). For TinyURL, Passport.js can be configured to authenticate users before they can access administrative features like viewing analytics or managing their shortened URLs.

## Functionality:

<b>URL Shortening:</b> Users can input a long URL, and the system generates a short, unique URL that redirects to the original long URL when accessed.

<b>Data Storage:</b> MongoDB stores mappings between short URLs and their corresponding long URLs. It provides durability and scalability for managing large volumes of URL mappings efficiently.

<b>Caching with Redis:</b> Redis is used to cache frequently accessed short URLs. When a short URL is requested, the system first checks Redis. If the short URL exists in the cache, it retrieves the corresponding long URL directly from Redis, improving response time. If not found in Redis, it falls back to MongoDB.

<b>Authentication with Passport.js:</b> Passport.js handles user authentication. It ensures that only authenticated users can access certain features, such as viewing statistics about their shortened URLs or managing their account.
